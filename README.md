# motherbox-admin

*__(5/17/2017) NOTE:__ This is currently a prototype for the UI and is not wired up to anything*

Font-end interface that will allow you to easily configure your `motherbox` settings.

### Custom Elements

To cut down on unnecessary bulk this project consists of only vanilla JavaScript and CSS - no libraries or external frameworks will be used outside of the Custom Elements polyfill for browsers that do not fully support the current spec. All components were created using the `Custom Element v1` spec and will include the `mb-` prefix.

- `mb-app`
- `mb-card`
- `mb-footer`
- `mb-icon`
- `mb-menu`
- `mb-menu-item`
- `mb-page`
- `mb-sidebar`
- `mb-textarea`
- `mb-toolbar`

### Compatibility

Currently only working in Chrome v54+ without polyfill.
